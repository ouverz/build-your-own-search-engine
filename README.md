I have completed the workshop and have added commentary and context, directly into the notebook, in areas of the code which I believe would be a reminder for me and hopefully help others who are trying to get some more information about Text Mining fundamentals.
I have a background in Text Mining and NLP from my Master Thesis where I used both to create ML models to categorize e-mails as
being fraud or non-fraud (fraud= written by scammers). For more about that, read my CV or contact me directly.
